# The JavaScript & it's History

JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language. JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.

## JS, ECMA, ES5, ES6, ES2017, ES2018 TC39 What Do They Mean??

As we know that for any software or programming language, new features are added from time to time. When you want to use the new features we download the latest version by going to particular link and update the version installed in our system.

But JavaScript is bit different in this case. There is an organisation called Ecma International: is an industry association dedicated to the standardization of information and communication systems. Ecma decides all the standards for JavaScript (which means what will be the rules of JS programming language) You can read more [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/ECMA).

All the browsers then follow these rules and implement in these browser (Chrome, Safari, IE). [Ecma International's TC39](https://tc39.es/) is a group of JavaScript developers, implementers, academics, and more, collaborating with the community to maintain and evolve the definition of JavaScript. Every year they meet and discuss new features and what should be added to JavaScript and once they finalise they release the document and browsers has to implement new features.

Initially the TC39 committee used to release the standards using naming ES5, ES6 but ES6 took alot of time and so they decided to change things and annually update the spec and use `Year` for naming like ES2015 (same as ES6), ES2016, ES2017.
